# AaMidiControllers

Midi controller scripts for Ableton Live (9/10).

With these scripts you can control 5 different types of MIDI controllers:

1) AaTransport: SubZero MiniControl MIDI-Kontroller
   With 9 volume faders, 1 channels fader, 9 buttons and 4 banks
2) AaRotary: Behringer BCR2000 B-Control Rotary MIDI Control Surface
   With 32 encoders, 16 buttons, 8 encoder-buttons, 4 modes and 16 banks
3) AaFader: Behringer BCF2000 B-Control Fader MIDI Control Surface
   With 8 motorized faders, 16 buttons, 8 encoder-buttons, 4 modes and 16 banks
4) AaGrid: Akai APC Mini Midi Controller
   With 64 pad buttons, 8 scene buttons, 8 strip buttons, 1 shift button and 9 faders
5) AaMatrix: Novation Launchpad Mini MK3
   With 64 pad buttons, 8 scene buttons, 8 strip buttons

With these scripts the Launchpad and the Akai APC can communicate with the BCF2000
to move the controlled channels.

The BCR2000 is programmed to support up to 6 MIDI channels with 56 encoders (32 + 24),
giving you the possibility to change 336 parameters quickly!

Two Akai APC Mini can be connected simultaneously to have a beatgrid of 16 beats x 8 notes.

The Launchpad can be used to change different parameters of the beatgrid giving the possibility
to create music and beatlines on the fly, totally effortless!

Looking forward to hear your comments!
